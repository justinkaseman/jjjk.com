    Welcome! We’re
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-kaseman/">Justin</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliejonak/">Julie</a>, two techies,
    currently working remotely and feeling cooped up after many months pandemic.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we’re hitting the road and taking these times as an opportunity to see
    the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ll share photos and highlights from each city we stop in, from sea to
    shining sea. Expect amateur photos, delicious food finds, and WFH approved
    Airbnbs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some upcoming stops are Flagstaff, Santa Fe, Abilene, Houston, Austin,
    Breaux Bridge, Seaside, Tampa, and Miami. Have a tip for one of these
    cities? Let us know!
